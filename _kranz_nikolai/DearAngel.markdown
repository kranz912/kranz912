## Dear Angel,
--------

 At the moment, we are in two separated places. Separated by millions of mountains, four ocean and seven seas. Perhaps no math can compute how much I want to be by your side.

It's very hard for me to court you from so far away. There are days, things may seem impossible. But there are a few things I want you to know and understand.

I care about you, despite the miles between us, I will never stop asking you how your day is, calling you whenever I miss you, or simply greet you to brighten your day in short lagi kitang kukulitin. Your happiness means everything to me. No matter how far away I am, promise you are always on my mind.

I wish I could be there with you each day, on your interviews, on your way to work, I wish I could sit across from you at the dinner table, I wish I can cook for you and greet you when you get home from duty, and go out to do fun things with you every weekend (tuturuan kitang lumangoy). 

You are the only one. Nobody will catch my attention, I  want you, and nobody else. Even with these miles between us, I will always be faithful to you.

I only met you once, but that's enough for me to love you.

I love you
-kranz

## Technical conversation
-------
My first conversation with her mom is kinda technical. Hahaha.
It started with Angel's spelling issues.
We talk about the grading system that they are using in her school. I was kinda nervous at first, it feels like a technical interview from google. Thank god it ended well. :)




## Changing me
--------

Waking up motivated and early just to be with you. Your night is my morning, ever since I met you I have changed myself. I have changed my schedule, uninstalled my computer games, and be more health conscious.
