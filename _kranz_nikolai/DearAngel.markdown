Starting to fall in love with this young lady from so far away.

Sending her my first love letter. 

## Dear Angel,
--------

 At the moment, we are in two separated places. Separated by millions of mountains, four ocean and seven seas. Perhaps no math can compute how much I want to be by your side.

It's very hard for me to court you from so far away (lalo na magkaiba ng timezone, minsan tinanong ni art kung natutulog pa ba ako hahaha). There are days, things may seem impossible. But there are a few things I want you to know and understand. (Nako english patay ka dito hahahah)

I care about you, despite the miles between us, I will never stop asking you how your day is, calling you whenever I miss you, or simply greet you to brighten your day in short lagi kitang kukulitin. Your happiness means everything to me isang kilay lang takot na ako. No matter how far away I am, promise you are always on my mind.

I wish I could be there with you each day, on your interviews, on your way to work, I wish I could sit across from you at the dinner table, I wish I can cook for you and greet you when you get home from duty, and go out to do fun things with you every weekend (tuturuan kitang lumangoy). 

You are the only one. Nobody will catch my attention, I  want you, and nobody else. Even with these miles between us, I will always be faithful to you.

I only met you once, but that's enough for me to love you.

I love you
-kranz

## Technical conversation
-------
My first conversation with her mom is kinda technical. Hahaha.
It started with Angel's spelling issues.
We talk about the grading system that they are using in her school. I was kinda nervous at first, it feels like a technical interview from google. Thank god it ended well. :)




## Changing me
--------

Waking up motivated and early just to be with you. Your night is my morning, ever since I met you I have changed myself. I have changed my schedule, uninstalled my computer games, and be more health conscious.

## Proposal

I asked her if what she felt with the flowers, she told me that she thinks that she loves me.
I decided to tell her everything, my intentions, my feelings. If she will be my girlfriend, I will make sure she will be my last one.

After hours of talking to the shop, helping them to find them. at last she received it. :)
She called me after and I pretend to be sleepy. Hahaha.

## Flowershop hunt
--------
It was the night before valentine's that I have decided to send her flowers. It was very hard to find a legit one especially those who can deliver on feb 14, the demand for flowers was very high that day. I even tried to call her hotel but no gist. I randomly picked one from my friends recommendations and ordered blindly. 

------
## Rant
------
Ranting is my best alibi, Calling her for no reason will result in her finding out my true feelings for her. LOL me and my hidden agendas hahahaha

------
## Facebook
------
Day’s had passed since I met Angel, I am waiting for her friend request since then. Then I saw a comment on Rogiel’s profile. It was Angel. Geez, this girl might not want to add me. LOL. I took up the courage and add her. A few days later she responded to my friend request. We began exchanging voice messages and I fell in love with her. :) :)

## Second time
------
I was back to Baguio to meet Maireen, a friend that I met in Boston. When I was in the bus, I realized that I forgot her chocolates at home. I decided to buy her chocolates at the department store. While on walking I saw a familiar person, trying to recognize her face for 20 seconds somehow my facial recognition algorithm was not working that day. It was too late when I shouted her name. Probably she didn't hear it, or perhaps it is a different person.

## Randomwalk
-----

A day after my birthday I decided to travel to my birthplace. It's been three and a half years since I left.  
Walking around the city without a plan and letting destiny to decide, makes me think of a pseudorandomness computational problem. Best things happen when it's unplanned.  
After walking around and eating everything I want, I got tired and decided to sit down somewhere. There I met a two young ladies, named Angel and Rogiel.
